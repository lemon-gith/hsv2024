# Hardware and Software Verification

This is a repo to hold the coursework done for the HSV module in 2024.

My coursework was done with my partner, (TODO: add link), with the work split approximately being:

| Coursework | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 | Task 4 | Task 5 | Task 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Isabelle | Both | Him | Me | Me | Him | Me |
| Dafny | Him | Him | Him | Him | X | - |
| Yosys | X | X | X | X | X | X |

`X` is yet to fill in

`-` just indicates that there was no such Task, since we attempted every task

## Isabelle
