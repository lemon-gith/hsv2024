# Hardware and Software Verification

This is a repo to hold the coursework done for the HSV module in 2024.

My coursework was done with my partner, [Jamie](https://github.com/jamie6264), with the work split approximately being:

| Coursework | Task 1 | Task 2 | Task 3 | Task 4 | Task 5 | Task 6 | Task 7 | Task 8 | Task 9 | Task 10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Isabelle | Both | J | P | P | J | P*^ | - | - | - | - |
| Dafny | J | J | J | J | J* | - | - | - | - | - |
| Yosys | P | P | P | P | P | P | J | J | P | P |

*didn't manage to complete in time for deadline\
^with some hints from a friend on the course

`-` just indicates that there was no such Task, since we attempted every task
